# Welcome to uWicLet!





**uWIclet COMPLIES with the 24-25 Sherwood Schools District student body handbook.**
It is to the responsibility of the user of uWIclet to engage in legal activities. uWiclet may allow users to losen the district's tight clench on the students data, but will not allow the district's precious squid cache server to be bypassed. Oh yeah and **uwiclet enforces CIPA**.

**uWicLet** is a tool that allows you to execute and manage bookmarklets using **uBlock Origin** by leveraging the **uBlock Run** exploit. This is especially useful if bookmarklets are blocked by your administrator or do not work on your device. **uWicLet** also includes some CSP bypassing techniques, making it functional on sites where regular **uBlock Run** or **uRun** fail, such as Blooket.

## **How to Use uWicLet**

### 1. **Opening uWicLet**
   - Press `CTRL + Shift + ~` to open uWicLet.
   - If you receive a warning about a strict **Content Security Policy (CSP)**, some bookmarklets may not work properlyâ€”especially those that load scripts from external sources.

### 2. **Adding Bookmarklets**
   - Locate the **"Enter bookmarklet code here"** text input.
   - You can either:
     - Copy and paste the bookmarklet code.
     - Drag a bookmarklet from your bookmarks bar into the input field.
   - Click the green **"Add Bookmarklet"** button.
   - Assign a name to your bookmarklet (which can be changed later).
   - You can store multiple bookmarklets, and they will persist even after closing your browser or restarting your device.

### 3. **Executing Bookmarklets**
   - Once added, your bookmarklet will appear with four buttons:
     - **Blue button**: Run the bookmarklet.
     - **Red button**: Delete the bookmarklet.
     - **Yellow buttons**: Edit the bookmarklet's name and code.

Some websites, such as **GitHub** or any **Google subdomain**, may completely block uWicLet due to strict **Content Security Policies** that are difficult to bypass. However, these cases are rare.
