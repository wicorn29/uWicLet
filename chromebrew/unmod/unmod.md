# Unmodding
At the end of each school year, it is critical that you remove all modifications from your chromebook.

To remove uWicLet, follow the insatll instructions, but reverse them. 
# YOU ARE NOT DONE YET!
Next, you NEED to remove Chromebrew. Download the unmod.html from this directory, and run it. This NEEDS TO HAPPEN or your school WILL detect the mods.

## why do i need to remove chromebrew?
uWIclet is simply the interface or "app" that communicates with Chromebrew. (chromebrew auto instals with uWicLet, this is because chromebrew installs into your chromebook)
